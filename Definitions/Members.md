# Members

**Core Members:** Core membership is the highest level within Linaro. Core members have a seat on the Linaro board of directors, two votes on the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and unlimited access to all of Linaro’s activities.

**Club Members:** Club membership is the starting point for most of ARM’s licensees who produce chips in a range of segments. There is one voted representative of the Club members on the Linaro board of directors and each Club member has one vote on the TSC.

**Group Members:** Group members have a vote on their group steering committee and an elected representative on the TSC. Group membership is a good way for companies with a focus in a particular segment to get involved and influence the direction of Linaro’s work in that segment.  There are currently five segment groups at Linaro:  [Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG)](Groups.md), [Linaro Home Group (LHG)](Groups.md), [Linaro Mobile Group (LMG)](Groups.md), [Linaro Networking Group (LNG)](Groups.md) and our newest group – [Linaro Community Board Group (LCG)](Groups.md). 

**Community Members:** Community membership is a special level of membership granted to organizations that have contributed significantly to Linaro’s development and is by invitation of the Linaro board.
